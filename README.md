# PythonSolitaire
There's not much to say here. This is solitaire, written in Python, to play in your terminal. I was bored in an airplane.

`python solitaire.py`

## Optional Arguments:
```python
usage: solitaire.py [-h] [--debug] [--draw-pile-size DRAW_PILE_SIZE]
                    [--max-loops MAX_LOOPS]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --debug, -g
  --draw-pile-size DRAW_PILE_SIZE
                        Choose your draw pile size.
  --max-loops MAX_LOOPS
                        Maximum number of times to loop through the draw deck

```
